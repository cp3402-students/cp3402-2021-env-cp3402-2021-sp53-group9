We rented the server of WordPress itself for the site, if someone who already knows WordPress taking over the running of the site itself want to add new content, They only need to log in to the administrator account on the WordPress server, and they can add new content on the page and post interface. 

If they want to manage previous pages or add content more conveniently, they can use the nicepage plugin directly, and the nicepage plugin will assist in management easily maintain and edit sites. Managers only need to upload the zip file downloaded from https://nicepage.com/download-wordpress#  in the add new pulgin interface to get the nicepage plugin.

our project contains only few pages to introduce and as a home page. Our content mostly focuses on posts.

We have mainly four categories: Home, About, Service and contact . Adding each post should be categorized into one of these four categories.

However, if in the future, the store is going to launch a new product or a new type of information that is not listed in these four categories; you may add a new father type category.

If the store wants to separate those products in more detail. You can add child category under the father category such as rent car underneath service, etc.

Adding a new post needs at least one picture and information about the new product. You should host your picture online in order to reduce the loading time of the web page.

We also use the plugin called NicePage. Its purpose is to control the pages. While making changes about the website such as information of the store, location, opening and closing time, you should use NicePage to edit and make changes.
