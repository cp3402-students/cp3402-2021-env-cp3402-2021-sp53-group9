# Deployment

Our development and deployment workflow, includes processes such as project management and version control. 

### Project Management

---

For project management, we planned using Trello, applying the AGILE methodology. We started with a product backlog consisting of small tasks (Tasks are represented by cards on the product backlog) that would build up to the finish product. 

We split our project into sprints, each sprint runs over the course of 1 week. For each sprint we would plan out what tasks we are going to do for the sprint, then we would move the relevant task cards from the product backlog to the sprint backlog. We will move the task cards along the board as we move forward on each step. 

e.g Product Backlog > Sprint Backlog > In Progress > Completed

Members would be assigned to different tasks using the "assign member" feature on the Trello cards.

### Communication

We communicate mainly through Discord, Whatsapp, or face-to-face meetings during our practical sessions.

### Version control

The website is created using WordPress on our individual VirtualMachines, so what we do to ensure everyone is working on the latest files is to use GitHub version control. We created a GitHub repository and did an initial commit of our WordPress project then created individual branches for us to work on without affecting the main branch.

When working on the website, pull the files from the repository, then when changes are made, commit and push increments to the Git repository. This method is called Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

For development on WordPress, we use Nicepage plugin to easier edit pages and deploy them to the live server.

After every large commit, each team member should pull the files and test to see if the website is working properly. If there are any issues, the member should sound off to the rest of the team then proceed to troubleshoot accordingly.

After we are done, we will upload the website from the local server to a live host server on WordPress server.
